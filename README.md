# Database of Drivers Licenses, Number Plates and Points

## Graphic Interface to add Drivers, remove/edit Drivers and Change amount of Points.

The folder system includes a range of different types of lists which were built using the "Practical Computing Science" courses at the Univseity of Bremen. The Drivers License Graphic Interface is found in the package FlensburgData.

The file *main.java* creates a GUI which facilitates:
- Adding a new *FlensburgPerson* to the created *FlensburgDatabase*
- Each Person has a Drivers License number, Number Plate and License Points
- The Drivers License number is a Unique ID for each person
- All other information can be edited/updated.

In this project I learnt to use hashing and lists in order to create and manage a database with the potential to hold a significant amount of data.
